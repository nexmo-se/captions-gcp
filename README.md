# How to Run the project

This application shows you how you can use the Vonage Video API along with Google Cloud APIs to build a captioning application in your language of your choice

# Run the app

1. `npm install`
2. `node index.js`
3. Populate a `.env` as per `.env.example` and copy-paste your google-credentials.json folder into the main project directory
4. Expose port 3001 or the port that you are using with ngrok
5. In public/index.html replace apiKey, sessionId, token and wsUrl (pointing to your publicly accessible server)
6. Open your ngrok URL and click on start session and then on start sending audio.

# Credentials explanation

- GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS is the json file that you obtain from Google when you create a project. It's the way to authenticate with Google.
- apiKey, secret, sessionId and token are the parameters in this case harcoded and generated in the [account portal](https://tokbox.com/account/) for the sake of simplicity. Bear in mind that the token needs to belong to the sessionId.
- websocket_url is the websocket URI of your server. That is, your server URL in a wss format. I recommend using ngrok for testing.
- Language is the language code of your choice. See this list for [languages supported](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/speech-to-text-supported-languages)
